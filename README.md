# Data Segmentation with PCA and K-Medoids Clustering

This repo is part of my undergraduate thesis project under [Dr. Nuning Nuraini S.Si.,M.Si.](https://scholar.google.co.id/citations?user=JWD0YN0AAAAJ&hl=id) supervision. It contains datasets and codes with the following objectives:

1. Demonstrate PCA (Principal Component Analysis) both from scratch and built-in function. 

2. Apply K-Medoids Clustering on PCA results to segment the data

### Updates:

  - 26/11/2020: Upload notes about delay
  
  - 27/11/2020: Upload processed datasets and raw codes (pardon my messy code structure :p)
